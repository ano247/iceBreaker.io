(In progress) Backend for a service which matches like-minded strangers based on real-time location and similar interests - Uses Node.js worker threads to delegate requests for each location

## 
1. Create user profile with email and password : Authentication and authorization using JWT
2. User enters a bookstore/cafe, and clicks on the location on their map, and the api sends them a list of potential users who are also in the same location and are potentially very like-minded
